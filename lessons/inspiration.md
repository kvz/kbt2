# Theory


Boxing is a combat sport in which two participants, generally of similar weight, fight each other with their fists in special gloves. A boxing match is supervised by a referee and typically consists of several rounds. There are three ways to win. Victory is achieved if the opponent is knocked out and unable to get up before the referee counts to ten seconds (a Knockout, or KO) or if the opponent is deemed too injured to continue (a Technical Knockout, or TKO). If there is no stoppage of the fight before an agreed number of rounds, a winner is determined either by the referee's decision or by judges' scorecards.


BOXING STANCES

The modern boxing stance differs substantially from the typical boxing stances of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The modern stance has a more upright vertical armed guard, as opposed to more horizontally held, knuckles facing the ground guard as seen among early 20th century boxers such as Jack Johnson. 

North American fighters tend to favor a more balanced stance, facing the opponent almost squarely, while many European fighters stand with their torso turned more to the side. The positioning of the hands may also vary, as some fighters prefer to have both hands raised in front of the face, risking exposure to body shots. 

If a boxer is right-handed, his left hand is the lead hand; his right hand is the rear hand (dominant). The following techniques apply to a right-handed boxer. A right-handed boxer's handedness is commonly described as orthodox. A left-handed boxer is called an unorthodox boxer or a Southpaw.

Right-side stance. In a fully upright stance, the boxer stands with the legs shoulder-width apart with the rear foot a half-step behind the lead foot. Right-handed or orthodox boxers lead with the left foot and fist. Both feet are pointed slightly inward, and the right heel is off the ground. The lead (left) fist is held vertically about six inches in front of the face at eye level. The rear (right) fist is held beside the chin and the elbow tucked against the ribcage to protect the body. The chin is tucked into the chest to avoid punches to the jaw which commonly cause knock-outs. Some boxers fight from a crouch, leaning forward and keeping their feet closer together.

Left-side stance. Left-handed or southpaw fighters use a mirror image of the orthodox stance, which can create problems for orthodox fighters unaccustomed to receiving jabs, hooks, or crosses from the opposite side. The southpaw stance, conversely, is vulnerable to a straight right hand.

Front stance. The position with gloves up at chin level, parallel to each other. The front stance is used in the infighting.


TYPES OF GUARD

Defensive positions (guards or styles) used in boxing. Some fighters may have their guard higher for more head protection while others have their guard lower to provide better protection against body punches. Many fighters vary their defensive style throughout a bout in order to adapt to the situation of the moment, choosing the position best suited to protect them.

Peek-a-boo. Sometimes known as the "earmuffs". This is the most common defensive style. The hands are placed next to each other in front of the face(like mentioned before fighters tend to vary the exact positioning in which they use it) and elbows are brought in tight to the body(this position can be achieved by bringing the elbows as close together while not straining yourself to do so). This defensive style is what a boxer is taught to do when they begin to box, after they gain experience they can decide to change or vary their guard. This style is middle of the road style in terms of counterpunching and damage reduction. A boxer can counter punch from this stance, but it is difficult, however, there have been boxers who can do this very well. This defense covers up a fighter well, but there are holes. Hooks do damage by going around the hands and by hitting just behind the elbows.

Cross-armed. The forearms are placed on top of each other horizontally in front of the face with the glove of one arm being on the top of the elbow of the other arm. This style is greatly varied when the back hand (right for an orthodox fighter and left for a southpaw) rises vertically. This style is the most effective for reducing head damage. The only head punch that a fighter is susceptible to is a jab to the top of the head. The body is open, but most fighters who use this style bend and lean to protect the body, but while upright and unaltered the body is there to be hit. This position is very difficult to counterpunch from, but virtually eliminates all head damage..

Crab or Philly Shell. The lead arm is placed across the torso usually somewhere in between the belly button and chest and the lead hand rests on the opposite side of the fighter's torso. The back hand is placed on the side of the face (right side for orthodox fighters and left side for southpaws). The lead shoulder is brought in tight against the side of the face (left side for orthodox fighters and right side for southpaws). This style is used by fighters who like to counterpunch. To execute this guard a fighter must be very athletic and experienced. This style is so effective for counterpunching because it allows fighters to slip punches by rotating and dipping their upper body and causing blows to glance off the fighter.


FOUR BAIC PUNCHES

There are four basic punches in boxing; all other ones are either combinations or variations of these four.

Cross. Powerful, straight punch done with the rear (dominant) hand. Starting from the guard position, the rear hand is thrown from the chin. It crosses the body and travels towards the target in a straight line. The rear shoulder is moved forward. It's finishing position is just outside the chin. Simultaneously, the lead hand is retracted and placed across the face to protect the inside of the chin. The torso and hips are rotated counter-clockwise as the cross is executed.

Hook. A semi-circular power punch done with the lead hand to the side of the opponent's head. Starting from the guard's position, the torso and hips and rotated clockwise. The fist is propelled through a tight, clockwise arc across the front of the body and connects with the target. Simultaneously, the lead foot pivots clockwise and the left heel turns outwards. Hook starts from the shoulder with the elbow bent so the arm forms sort of a hook; the fist travels from the side toward the center. The temple, side of the jaw, ribs and liver is the target.

Jab. A quick, straight snapping punch done with the lead hand from the guard position. Jab is thrown quickly from the shoulder with your leading hand; can be used as an offensive and defensive weapon. A jab is the busiest punch in boxing. There is a small, clockwise rotation of the torso and hips. The fist rotates 90 degrees and becomes horizontal after impact. When the punch reaches full extension, the lead shoulder is brought upwards to guard the chin. The rear hand is placed nearby the face to protect the jaw. This is the most vital punch for a boxer as it has a good amount of cover and leaves minimum space for a counterpunch from the opponent. Can also be used as a way to gauge distance, to keep an opponent wary, or as a defensive move to slow an advancing opponent

Uppercut. A vertical, rising punch done with the rear (dominant) hand. Starting from the guard's position, the torso shifts slightly to the right and the rear hand drops below the level of the opponent's chest. There must be a slight bend in the knees. Further, the rear hand is thrust upwards in a rising arc towards the opponent's chin or torso. Simultaneously, the knees push upwards fast and the torso and hips rotate anti-clockwise. The rear heel turns outward and imitates the body movement of the cross. Uppercut is usually used at close quarters (classic uppercut). Uppercut aiming to body is called body uppercut. It is, along with the cross, one of the two main punches that count in the statistics as power punches. Uppercuts are useful when thrown at close range, because they are considered to cause more damage when at close range. A flashy wide sweeping uppercut is called bolo punch. It is a flashy wide sweeping uppercut thrown “from the floor”. The bolo punch might not even be thrown at all but rather used to distract the opponent so you can hit them with your other hand. It is more out showboating than power. The bolo punch might not even be thrown at all but rather used to distract the opponent so you can hit them with your other hand.


DEFENSIVE TECHNIQUES

Defense is tactics and moves used in order to repulse an attack.

Active defense, Combination moves for neutralization of attacker’s punches and delivering counter punches.

Passive defense. Relatively prolonged activities for neutralization of attacker’s punches.

Defense in depth. Boxer’s activities totally dedicated to neutralization of attacker’s punches.

Block. Executed by keeping the hands up (to block punches), the chin down (to protect it behind the gloves), and the eyes on the opponent (to see what's happening). Generally the right glove blocks the opponent's left-hand punches. Using the boxer's shoulder, hands or arms as defensive tools to protect against incoming attacks. A block generally receives a punch while a parry tends to deflect it. A "palm" or "cuff" is a block which intentionally takes the incoming punch on that portion of the defender's glove.

Bob and Weave. Bobbing moves the head laterally and beneath an incoming punch. As the opponent's punch arrives, the boxer bends the legs quickly and simultaneously **shifts** the body either slightly right or left. Once the punch has been evaded, the boxer "weaves" back to an upright position, emerging on either the outside or inside of the opponent's still-extended arm. To move outside the opponent's extended arm is called "bobbing to the outside". To move inside the opponent's extended arm is called "bobbing to the inside".

Clinch (or Hold). When a boxer holds on to his or her opponent to avoid being hit or muffle an opponent's attack. A clinch is a last resort defensive technique. Clinch is a rough form of grappling and occurs when the distance between both fighters has closed and straight punches cannot be employed. In this situation, the boxer attempts to hold or "tie up" the opponent's hands so he is unable to throw hooks or uppercuts. Clinching is a temporary match state and is quickly dissipated by the referee.

Cover-Up. Covering up is the last opportunity (other than rolling with a punch) to avoid an incoming strike to an unprotected face or body. Generally speaking, the hands are held high to protect the head and chin and the forearms are tucked against the torso to impede body shots. When protecting the body, the boxer rotates the hips and lets incoming punches "roll" off the guard. To protect the head, the boxer presses both fists against the front of the face with the forearms parallel and facing outwards. This type of guard is weak against attacks from below.

Parry. Parrying an incoming attack or moving an attacker's punch aside at distance using boxer's shoulder, hands or arms.

Rolling. One of the basic strategies of defensive boxing - along with slipping and ducking, blocking, and holding and clinching. Similar to ducking (moving under and thus avoiding getting hit by a punch), while also responding with a punch of your own.

**Slip**. Slipping is rotating the body slightly so that an incoming punch passes harmlessly next to the head. As the opponent's punch arrives, the boxer sharply rotates the hips and shoulders. This turns the chin sideways and allows the punch to "slip" past. Using slips is valid but risky with uppercuts since the punch is usually too close when the defender can determine the exact line of the punch. To overcome the hooks problem, the defender usually incorporate slipping (also called weaving) with ducking (also called bobbing - as in bob and weave).

Sway or Fade – Anticipating a punch and move the upper body or head back so that it misses or has its force appreciably lessened. Also called "rolling with the punch" or "Riding The Punch".

Slipping (Bobbing). One of the basic strategies of defensive boxing, executed by slightly moving the head to either side so that the opponent's punches slip by the boxer's head. You use the slip to evade swings, jabs, and straight punches. It can not be used with hooks as they move on the side level.


PECULIAR TECHNIQUES AND TACTICS

Body Punch (Body shot). A punch delivered to the opponent’s body. Body punches particularly a left hook delivered to the floating rib area (the bottom of the rib cage and towards the side) where the liver is can stop a fighter if landed perfectly. Body punches delivered not quite so precisely but repeatedly round after round wears a boxer down. A sore gut, bruised ribs makes it hard to breath.

Chopping. Exchange with short blows in infighting (esp. downward ones while in a clinch). Chopping is irregular punching at close quarters without using sophisticated boxing techniques.

Combination. A series of punches thrown in sequence like the triple - a left jab, followed by a straight right, followed by a left hook or the double – right straight, left straight.

Counterpunch. A counter-attack begun immediately after an opponent throws a punch, exploiting the opening in the opponent's position.

Double. Common used combination of left and right jabs.

Duck or Break. Dropping down with the back straight so that a punch aimed at the head glances or misses entirely. Similar to slipping (slightly moving the head from side-to-side to avoid getting hit), but here the head moves down to avoid the punch, with the boxer bending at the waist and at the knees. Under most, if not all, modern rules of boxing, it is illegal to duck lower than the opponent's belt line.

Haymaker. A wild swinging punch thrown with all of the person's weight behind it in an attempt to knock out the other person. You usually see haymakers in street fighting or in the movies. Haymakers are also used in boxing as a last resort. They deliver enough force to break a man's jaw. The term first appeared in 1912, perhaps from the 1880 "hit the hay" or "go to sleep".

Feint. A fake punch or any offensive movement used to get your opponent to react and move out of his good offensive position opening the opponent up to your real attack.

Illegal moves. Dirty Fighting. Holding an opponent's head down and hitting face with uppercuts or ribs with hooks, rabbit punches (to the neck or to the base of the skull), elbowing, forearm in the throat, armbar in a clinch, late punches, low blows, kidney punch, lacing (using glove laces to rub the opponent's face), step on an opponent's foot and punch, continuous headbutting and making it look accidental

Infighting. Fighting at close quarters so that blows from the opponent, using the full reach of his arm, cannot be delivered. When boxers fight at close quarters without being able to fully extend their arms when punching

Jolt. Straight quick stunning punch.

Lay Back. Being in the position ‘lay back’ in order to wait for the opponent to make the first move. The trick behind this defensive move is the subsequent element of surprise. As the opponent moves forward and prepares to strike, spring forward and into action, punching him/her when he/she least expects it. In this attacking situation, it is best to keep your punches short and sharp.

Liver Punch. A short quick punch to the liver delivered with a left hook. It's one of the most devastating punches in boxing. It's sickening as well as paralyzing

Straight Right (straight left). A straight right is considered power punch. If you are a right handed boxer it's a straight right. If you are a left handed boxer it's a straight left.

Outfighting. Unlike infighting, fighting at a distance and not at close range. This position is a main in any boxing bout.

Sunday Punch. A knockout blow, a punch that renders an opponent unable to continue fighting.

Sway or Fade. Defensive technique. Anticipating a punch, move the upper body or head back so that it misses or has its force appreciably lessened. Also called "rolling with the punch" or "Riding The Punch".

Swing. A long hook. Unlike a regular hook, foe a swing the arm usually is fully extended, or nearly so.

Preferred body parts to be punched. The parts of a human body and head allowed for punching, which are most vulnerable are the most attractive for an attacker. Sharp blows to those parts might cause reflex damage in functional condition of the brain, cardiovascular system and respiratory apparatus as well as painful break; as a result - dysfunction of the orientation ability. The most vulnerable body parts are the head (especially, the lower jaw and nose), side part of the neck, upper belly, the liver area (right part of the belly) and female breasts. The nose is the most available part of the face. The nose sticks out, providing a great target for a well-placed punch, which can easily produce a painful break and bleeding.


BOXER CLASSIFICATION

Out-fighter. A boxer who seeks to keep a distance with an opponent, fighting with faster, longer range punches, most notably the jab. Out-fighters usually are good strategists and tend to win by point decisions rather than by knockout. Out-fighters need reach, hand speed, reflexes, and footwork.

Puncher. A boxer who is willing to fight at close range with a combination of technique and power, often with the ability to knock opponents out with a combination and in some instances a single shot. Their movement and tactics are similar to that of an out-fighter but they tend to wear their opponents down. A boxer must be well rounded to be effective using this style.

Brawler/Slugger. A fighter who compensates lack of skills and footwork by sheer punching power. Many brawlers prefer a less mobile, more stable platform and have difficulty pursuing fighters who are fast on their feet. They may also have a tendency to ignore combination punching in favor of continuous beat-downs with one hand and by throwing slower, more powerful single punches Their slowness and predictable punching pattern (single punches with obvious leads) often leaves them open to counter punches, so successful brawlers must be able to absorb substantial amounts of punishment.

Swarmer/In-fighter. "Pressure fighter". A boxer attempting to stay close to an opponent, throwing intense flurries and combinations of hooks and uppercuts. A successful in-fighter needs a good "chin" because swarming usually involves being hit with many jabs before he/she can maneuver inside. In-fighters are generally shorter and have less reach than their opponents and thus are more effective at a short distance.

Counter-puncher. A slippery defensive style fighter. Counter-puncher uses his/her well rounded defense to avoid or block shots. Avoiding or blocked attacker's punches, counter-puncher returns one using the opponent's momentum or confusion. Counter-puncher mostly fights at a close range, To be successful using this style he or she must have well rounded overall skills, a sharp boxing brain.


BASIC TERMS AND RULES

Disqualification (DQ). When a bout is stopped short of knockout or judges' decision because, intentionally, one or both contestants have repeatedly or flagrantly fouled an opponent or violated other rules. The disqualified boxer automatically loses the bout to the opponent. If both are disqualified, (termed a double disqualification) the result is usually declared a no contest regardless of round.

Corner. A place of the ring assigned to each fighter where he/she rests in between rounds and where the trainers stand. Typically, three persons stand in the corner besides the boxer; these are the trainer, the assistant trainer and the cutman. The trainer and assistant typically give advice to the boxer as encourage him/her if he/she is losing. The cutman is a cutaneous doctor responsible for keeping the boxer's face and eyes free of cuts and blood. This is of particular importance because many fights are stopped because of cuts that threaten the boxer's eyes. In addition, the corner is responsible for stopping the fight if they feel their fighter is in grave danger of permanent injury. The corner will occasionally literally throw in a white towel to signify a boxer's surrender.

Draw. When both boxers tie or earn equal number of points from the judges' scoring the fight.

Knockdown. When a boxer get hits and touches the floor with any part of the his body other than his feet, is being held up by the ropes, or is hanging on, through, or over the ropes and cannot protect himself or fall to the floor.

Knockout (KO). When a boxer fails to reach his or her feet by the count of 10. In other words, when he or she is unable to get up unassisted after being floored by the count of ten.

Neutral corner. A place of the ring where a fighter must stand while his/her opponent is knocked down or assisted.

Split decision. Occurs when two of the three judges score one boxer as the winner, while the third judge scores the other boxer as the winner.

Technical Knockout (TKO). When a referee stops a fight declaring a participant unable to continue because of bad cuts or bruises, or inability a boxer to go on or defend him-/herself.

Ten Point Must System. In the 10 Point Must System of scoring a fight the winner of a round must receive 10 points. The loser of a round will receive from 9 to 6 points. A close round: 10-9. One knockdown: 10-8. Two knockdowns: 10-7. Three knockdowns: 10-6. No knockdown but one fighter completely dominates round: 10-8. Can't pick a winner: 10-10.

Throw in the towel (sponge). Acknowledge defeat by corner persons (seconds or trainers) when they consider their boxer shouldn't continue the fight because of severe beating - they throw a towel or sponge into the ring to stop the carnage, to end the fight by TKO.

Unanimous Decision (UD). Occurs when all three judges agree on a winner.

Weight-In. A pre-fight ceremony where boxers are weighed to make sure they are within the limits for their weight classes and contracted weight for the fight.


MISCELLANEOUS

Chin. Having a chin, whiskers or granite like jaw means having the ability to absorb punches when getting hit with a big shot and stay standing, to remain on feet despite seeing black flashing lights, blurred, double or triple vision and feeling a buzz that goes all the way to your toes.

Mismatch. When one of two boxers is decisively stronger and dominates on the ring, so they are not suitable for fighting each other

Groggy. A condition when a boxer is dazed, semi-conscious and staggers after getting a blow.

Saved by the bell. A situation when the bell rings signaling the end of the round before the referee finishes his count or a boxer is in a hopeless situation at the moment of the bell.

Southpaw. A left handed fighter (unorthodox). To a "normal" right handed fighter a southpaw's punches are coming from the wrong side. When a right handed and left handed boxer fight each other their lead foot is almost on top of the other persons. Southpaws aren't always born left handed some are converted southpaws.
